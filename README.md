# Classic Cars Sales Project
For this personal project, I create dashboards to a classic cars company. This could be useful for any executives, if they want to see how good the company's performance is and also what metrics they want to be focused on. In my dashboards, there are signification informations related to executives' needs, customer details, and product details.

By achieving my 'fictional' success criteria to save **most of the time** for sales analyst team to do other significant analysis and **most of the cost** of the company, these dashboard can tell well about how the executives make their decision. These are the screenshot of my dashboards.
